**Objective:** Develop forecasting model for airline bookings demand and improve the benchmark error level in existing forecasting  model.                

**Technologies Used:** Python, pandas, NumPy, ggplot

**Result/Key Takeaways:** We developed 3 different models - Multiplicative, Additive and OLS Regression. With 21.39% improvement over the benchmark errors, Additive model performed best and was recommended to be used for forecasting the airline demand.
